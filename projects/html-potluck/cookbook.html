        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 (8 oz/227 g) blocks full fat 
                <b>cream cheese</b>
                ,
                <br> 
                total weight of 16 oz, softened to room 
                <br> 
                temperature
            </li>
            <li>
                3/4 cup (6 oz/177 ml) full fat sweetened <br> 
                <b>condensed milk</b>
            </li>
            <li>3 large <b>eggs</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Spray the interior of a 7-inch 
                round<br> spring form cake pan or a solid one-piece 7 inch round
                cake pan<br> with cooking spray and then line it with a large 
                enough sheet of<br> parchment paper so that it completely covers
                the interior of the cake<br> pan. Press the parchment paper as 
                much as possible into the sides of<br> the pan so that it sticks
                to the sides of the pan and doesn’t cause too<br> many indents 
                in the final cake. You must line your cake pan with a<br> single
                sheet of parchment paper if using a springform pan because<br> 
                otherwise, the batter will leak through. The cake is supposed to
                <br>look rustic.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add all ingredients to a food processor. Blend on high speed 
                until<br> you have a smooth batter. Pause a few times to scrape 
                the sides of<br> the food processor with a spatula to make sure 
                all the ingredients<br> are incorporated.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Place the cake into 
                the<br> oven and bake for about 15-18 minutes or until the edges
                turn a<br> dark brown and puff up. Watch the cake carefully 
                during the last<br> few minutes of baking so that it doesn't 
                burn. The center will still<br> be quite jiggly, more pale in 
                color and slightly sunken in. Do not<br> wait for the center to 
                be fully cooked. The cake is not supposed to<br> be set in the 
                center. Also, the edges of your cake will burn if you<br> cook 
                it too long.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the cheesecake cool and set before eating. As it cools, the 
                <br> sides will deflate a little so that the cake surface 
                becomes even.<br> The cake can be enjoyed soon after it is fully
                cooled but for the<br> best flavor I recommend refrigerating the
                cake for a few hours.<br> This helps the flavors develop better 
                and it also will help the cake<br> set firmer so that it is 
                easier to cut and serve. Store any uneaten<br> cake in the 
                fridge.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 large, ripe <b>avocados</b>, halved and de-seeded
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ medium <b>red onion</b>, finely diced (approx. ¼ cup)
            </li>
            <li>
                2 <b>jalapeño peppers</b>, de-seeded as desired and 
                <br>finely diced
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cloves <b>garlic</b>, roughly chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                1 large, juicy <b>lime</b> or 1 small lemon, juiced 
                <br>(approx. 3 tablespoons)
            </li>
            <li>
                ⅓ cup finely chopped <b>cilantro</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon <b>kosher salt</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                heaping ½ teaspoon <b>garlic powder</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                heaping ½ teaspoon <b>chile lime seasoning</b> such<br>
                as <b>Tajíin</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>for serving, as desired:</i> finely chopped cilantro,<br> 
                tortilla chips, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Smash the aromatics:</b> Add the onion, jalapeno, and garlic 
                to a resealable<br> bag. Season with a pinch of kosher salt. 
                Seal the bag, pressing out as<br> much air as possible so the 
                bag doesn’t pop. Using a rolling pin or<br> heavy-bottomed pan, 
                carefully smash down on the bag to release the<br> natural 
                juices of the vegetables. The aromatics should be juicy and<br> 
                softened, but not smashed into a fine paste. (Alternatively, if 
                you have<br> a large mortar and pestle or traditional molcajete,
                you can combine all<br> of the ingredients in the bowl and use 
                the handle to press down and<br> smash the aromatics.)
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mix the guacamole:</b> Use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh
                into a<br> large bowl, then add the smashed vegetables from Step
                1 and all<br> remaining listed ingredients (lime juice – Tajín).
                Use a wooden spoon<br> to gently smash the avocados to your 
                desired consistency and stir to<br> combine well. Taste and 
                adjust seasoning as desired – depending on the<br> size of your 
                avocados, you may need a little extra salt or lime juice.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Serve:</b> Transfer the guacamole to a serving dish. Garnish 
                with additional<br> cilantro and serve immediately with tortilla
                chips. This guacamole is also<br> a wonderful add-on for any of 
                your favorite tacos, taco salads, burrito<br> bowls, nachos, and
                more. Enjoy!

            <li>1 tablespoon <b>Dijon mustard</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Begin by cooking the pasta according to package instructions. 
                Drain<br> and set aside. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Shred all the cheese and mix it in a bowl, then divide the 
                mixture<br> into two portions. In a small bowl, prepare the 
                seasoning by<br> combining salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 
                smoked paprika.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large pan, melt butter over medium heat to start the roux. 
                Once<br> the butter is melted, stir in half of the seasoning, 
                followed by the<br> flour. Gradually whisk in the evaporated 
                milk, stirring vigorously to<br> eliminate any lumps. Cook until
                the mixture thickens and begins to<br> boil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the heavy cream and the remaining seasoning, continuing to 
                <br>stir. Stir in Dijon mustard and cook until the sauce 
                thickens further.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly add the shredded cheese to the roux, a little at a time, 
                stirring<br> until fully melted. Once the cheese is 
                incorporated, mix in the cooked<br> pasta, ensuring it’s evenly 
                coated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Grease a baking dish and pour in half of the pasta mixture. 
                Layer it<br> with half of the remaining shredded cheese, then 
                add the rest of the<br> pasta. Top with the remaining shredded 
                cheese.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake the dish in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top 
                is fully<br> melted. For a crispy, golden crust, broil for an 
                additional 2 minutes. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven, garnish with fresh chopped chives, and 
                <br>serve warm.
