        <h1>The Trip of the Sea</h1>
        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            You go back to the hotel and have a nice time by the pool with your 
            family, when you go back to your room with the idea of admiring the 
            gorgeous view, however when you arrive you see the gut-wrenching 
            storm in the far distance, the sky is completely black filled with 
            thunder. Good thing you chose not to go on the trip with the 
            strange old man.
