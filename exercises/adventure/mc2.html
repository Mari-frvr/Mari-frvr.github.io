        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            Something about Jack was off, so you decided to go back and see if 
            there's anything else to do. But, your parents are saying they're 
            tired and when you stop to think what you should do next, you 
            realize you are too.
        </p>
        <h3>Choice 2</h3>
        <p>So, what will you do?</p>
