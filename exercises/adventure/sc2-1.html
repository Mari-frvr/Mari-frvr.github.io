        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            You asked the nice young girl you had previously bumped into once 
            you and your family arrived on the island. Good thing sheâ€™s the one 
            who distributes the news, she happens to know the island very well! 
            She suggests you go to a very nice restaurant where you watch an 
            immersive show done by the locals while eating. Turns out the 
            restaurant has amazing service and you and your family have a great 
            time.
