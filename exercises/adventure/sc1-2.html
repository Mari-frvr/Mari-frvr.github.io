        <h1>The Trip of the Sea</h1>
        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            The trip starts peacefully, but dark clouds soon gather, and the
            wind howls through the sails. Jack’s calm fades as towering waves 
            crash against the boat. Lightning flashes, revealing strange shadows
            beneath the water. He turns back through the storm, fighting the 
            current. When you finally reach the dock, the rain stops—but the 
            beach is deserted. Chairs overturned, belongings scattered—the 
            entire island has been evacuated.
