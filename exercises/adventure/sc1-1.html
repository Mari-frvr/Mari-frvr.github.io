        <h1>The Trip of the Sea</h1>
        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            As Jack sails farther than you expected, the water begins to shimmer
            in shades of turquoise and gold beneath the setting sun. Suddenly
            , dolphins leap beside the boat, and Jack smiles knowingly. He 
            tells you to hold on tight as he steers toward a cluster of rocks. 
            Behind them, a secret lagoon reveals itself—hidden from tourists for
            generations.
        </p>
        <p>The air is warm and peaceful, and bioluminescent fish 
            begin to glow as twilight falls. You realize you’ve just discovered 
            the island’s best-kept secret—a memory your family will treasure 
            forever. Turns out, Jack wasn't so bad afterall.</p>
